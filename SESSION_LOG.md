## 2026-06-13 — Dedicated CPU-only conda env

Confirmed the viewer needs **no GPU** (no torch/cellpose/CUDA/MPS — it only
views pre-computed masks). Added `environment.yml` and created a dedicated
**`cellscope_analysis`** env (conda-forge: python 3.11, numpy, tifffile,
pyqtgraph 0.14, pyqt 5.15, matplotlib, pytest). Verified in the new env:
`torch present? False`, `pytest` 3/3 pass, headless GUI smoke OK. Docs
(README, CLAUDE.md, requirements.txt) updated to prefer this env;
`cellpose4` still works as a fallback.

## 2026-06-13 — Project bootstrap (viewer + analysis scaffold)

Split a dedicated analysis project out of `cellscope` to keep detection-result
review/analysis simple and expandable. Initial scope: **view recordings with
their mask overlays in a GUI**, with a GUI-free analysis package to grow.

- **Stack**: PyQt5 + pyqtgraph (already in CellScope's `cellpose4` env; no new
  deps). napari was considered but isn't installed and is heavier.
- **IO** (`maskviewer/io/`): `load_recording` (`.ome.tif` `(T,C,H,W)` +
  `.ome.json` sidecar), `load_masks` (`masks.npz` → `labels (T,H,W)`),
  `discover` (walks `data_roots` for recording folders).
- **GUI** (`maskviewer/gui/`): `ImageCanvas` (base channel + LUT-coloured
  label overlay, outline mode, hover→cell ID), `ControlPanel`, `ViewerWindow`
  (channel/frame/opacity, ←/→ stepping, status bar). Verified headless with
  `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`: loads, scrubs, channel switch, outline, hover.
- **analysis** (`maskviewer/analysis/label_stats.py`): per-frame counts,
  areas, track lengths, centroids, `summary` — the expansion seed.
- **Data policy**: PUBLIC repo → **no real data committed**. Real recordings
  referenced via gitignored `config.json` (`data_roots`); committed
  `sample_data/Pos_demo/` is **synthetic** (`scripts/make_sample_data.py`).
  Verified discovery finds the synthetic sample AND the 48 real IC295
  recordings via a local `config.json`.
- Docs: README, CLAUDE.md (handoff + data formats + expansion seeds),
  INTERFACE.md (navigation map), MIT LICENSE.

Headless smoke (the agent's GUI test without a screen):
```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen conda run -n cellpose4 python - <<'PY'
from PyQt5 import QtWidgets; import sys
from maskviewer.config import load_config
from maskviewer.io import discover
from maskviewer.gui import ViewerWindow
app=QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
w=ViewerWindow(discover(load_config()['data_roots']))
w.controls.frame.setValue(3); print(w.status.currentMessage())
PY
```

Next ideas (see CLAUDE.md): CSV export + plots from `analysis/`, a per-cell
info panel, an HTTP remote-control hook for headless agent testing.
